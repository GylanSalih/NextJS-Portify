## Introduction

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows developers to create complex layouts with ease. In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a **flexible grid layout with cards** that looks great on any screen size.

## Basic Grid Structure

First, we create the HTML structure for the grid. Each card is a `<div>` inside the grid container.


## CSS Styling for the Grid

Next, we define the CSS to create the grid layout. Using `display: grid` and `grid-template-columns`, we can control the number of columns and spacing.


## Responsive Behavior

By using `auto-fit` with `minmax`, the grid automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the available width. On smaller screens, cards stack vertically, while on larger screens, multiple columns appear.

## Adding More Content

You can easily add more cards by duplicating the `<div class="card">` element inside the container. The grid will automatically adapt without additional changes to the CSS.

## Conclusion

CSS Grid makes it straightforward to create flexible, responsive layouts. Using cards inside a grid allows you to showcase content in a visually appealing and organized way. Combine this approach with hover effects, animations, or interactive elements to create engaging UI components.
